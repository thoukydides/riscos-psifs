    <CMDN> selects the <PSIFS LONG> as the filing system for subsequent operations. Remember that it is not necessary to switch filing systems if you use the full pathnames of objects. For example, you can refer to <ARG>ADFS</ARG> objects (on a local harddisc, say) when <PSIFS> is the current filing system.
