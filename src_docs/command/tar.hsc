    <CMDN> reads the contents of a <ARG>tar</ARG> file. All of the variants supported by <NAME>SparkFS</NAME> are handled, including <ARG>arctar</ARG>, <ARG>comma</ARG>, <ARG>fltar</ARG> and <ARG>unix</ARG>. However, this command is intended solely to allow restoration of backup files produced by <PSIFS>.
    <P>
    The default pattern is <ARG>*</ARG>, which will match all objects within the source file. The default directory is <ARG>@</ARG>, which corresponds to the current directory.
    <P>
    The <ARG>-verbose</ARG> switch displays a listing of the matching files contained within the source file. If this switch is used without specifically specifying a directory then no files will be extracted from the <ARG>tar</ARG> file.
</CMDU>
