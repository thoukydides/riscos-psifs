<CMD CMD="PsiFSDisable" DESC="Disable use of the configured block driver">
<CMDS>[-abort]</CMDS>
<CMDP PARAM="-abort">disconnect immediately without flushing data</CMDP>
<CMDU>
    <CMDN> closes any active connection and ends use of the configured block driver. This allows other programs to use the serial port.
    <P>
    The <ARG>-abort</ARG> switch does not wait for data to be flushed, so may result in data being lost. It should only be used as a last resort.
    <P>
    No action is taken if the block driver is already disabled.
