        This message is broadcast by a task that wants the <PSIFS> filer to process a page from a print job.
        <P>
        The possible actions are:
        <TABLE BORDER=1 ALIGN=CENTER>
            <TR><TH>Action</TH><TH>Description</TH></TR>
            <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT>0</TD><TD>open control window</TD></TR>
            <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT>1</TD><TD>display preview</TD></TR>
            <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT>2</TD><TD>start printing</TD></TR>
        </TABLE>
        <P>
        If <PSIFS> accepts the print job then it will take a copy of the file and acknowledge the message.
