        This message is broadcast by a task that has started an asynchronous remote operation using <SWIL SWI="PsiFS_AsyncStart" HREF=":swi/astrt.html"> to request that the <PSIFS> filer accept ownership of the operation and open an action window for it.
        <P>
        If <PSIFS> accepts the transfer of ownership then it will acknowledge the message, and will take responsibility for calling <SWIL SWI="PsiFS_AsyncEnd" HREF=":swi/aend.html"> at the appropriate time.
    </WIMPU>
