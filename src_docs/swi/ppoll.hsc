        Poll the status of the specified print job. This is only appropriate for <EPOC> devices.
        <P>
        If R0 is 0 on entry then this returns information about the next unclaimed print job. The handle of the print job is returned in R0.
        <P>
        The possible values for the status are:
        <TABLE BORDER=1 ALIGN=CENTER>
            <TR><TH>Value</TH><TH>Description</TH></TR>
            <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT>0</TD><TD>no print job active</TD></TR>
            <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT>1</TD><TD>start of print job received but not accepted</TD></TR>
            <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT>2</TD><TD>print job accepted</TD></TR>
            <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT>3</TD><TD>print job complete</TD></TR>
            <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT>4</TD><TD>print job cancelled</TD></TR>
        </TABLE>
        <P>
        The values in R2 and R3 are the counts of the number of complete pages received and the number of pages read via <SWIL SWI="PsiFS_PrintJobData">. Each print job starts with a dummy page, so these counts are both one higher than the number of real pages.
    </SWIU>
