        Poll for new intercepted file transfers. The same pollword as returned by <SWIL SWI="PsiFS_Register"> must be specified. This should be called repeatedly until the returned handle is 0 indicating no more files.
        <P>
        Each intercepted file transfer will have been saved to a temporary file. <SWIL SWI="PsiFS_InterceptControl"> should be used to specify the action to perform. The intercept types are the same as used for the mask supplied to <SWIL SWI="PsiFS_InterceptClaim">. More than one intercept type may be specified, for example if the intercept was forced by the user.
