        This call starts an asynchronous remote operation, depending on the reason code in R0. Valid reason codes are:

        <P>
        These operations may only be performed if the remote link is enabled and a connection has been established. If a connection has not been established, then the operation will complete with an error status.
        <P>
        Any <PSIFS> file names supplied as parameters must be of the form <ARG>:<ARGU>drive</ARGU>.$.<ARGU>file/directory</ARGU></ARG> where <ARG><ARGU>drive</ARGU></ARG> is a single character drive letter (<ARG>A</ARG> to <ARG>Z</ARG>), and <ARG><ARGU>file/directory</ARGU></ARG> is the path to the object. Other file names may be specified in any convenient form, although use of canonicalised paths is recommended.

        Restart the tasks listed in the specified file. Each line of the file should contain two file names separated by a space; the first is the application to start, and the second file is the file to open. If an application should be started without opening a file then the second file name should be left blank, but the space must still be included.

        Perform a backup of all files starting from the specified <SIBO> or <EPOC> directory. The output is written to a <NAME>tar</NAME> file to preserve long filenames, using the <NAME>fltar</NAME> (<ARG>Archie</ARG>) extensions to store datestamp and attribute information. If a previous backup file is specified then unmodified files are simply copied rather than being retrieved from the <SIBO> or <EPOC> device. If a scrap backup file is also specified then files not used from the previous backup file are copied to keep a record of previous versions.

    <SWIU>
        Ensure that the specified installer is present on the <SIBO> or <EPOC> device, and then use it to open the specified package.
        <P>
        This checks if the specified executable is present, and if not the installer file is copied and executed. Note that all drives are searched for the executable; the drive specified is only used if the installer file is executed. The package file itself is then copied, and the installer executable used to open it.
        <P>
        The typical use of this operation is to install SIS files on <EPOC> devices, ensuring first that the <ARG>Add/remove</ARG> icon is present on the <NAME>control&nbsp;panel</NAME>.
