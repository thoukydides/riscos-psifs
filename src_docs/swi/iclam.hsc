        This call allows file transfers within the desktop for the specified file type to be intercepted. The same pollword as returned by <SWIL SWI="PsiFS_Register"> must be specified. The types of intercept to claim are specified by setting bits in the mask passed in R2:
        <TABLE BORDER=1 ALIGN=CENTER>
            <TR><TH>Bit</TH><TH>Intercept claimed when set</TH></TR>
            <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT NOWRAP>0</TD><TD>forced by user</TD></TR>
            <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT NOWRAP>1</TD><TD>load from filer</TD></TR>
            <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT NOWRAP>2</TD><TD>save to filer</TD></TR>
            <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT NOWRAP>3</TD><TD>transfer between applications</TD></TR>
            <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT NOWRAP>4</TD><TD>all opens from filer</TD></TR>
            <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT NOWRAP>5</TD><TD>unclaimed opens from filer</TD></TR>
            <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT NOWRAP>6 ~ 31</TD><TD>must be 0</TD></TR>
        </TABLE>
        <P>
        If no bits are set in the mask then the intercept is released. Alternatively, all intercepts may be released by calling <SWIL SWI="PsiFS_InterceptRelease"> or <SWIL SWI="PsiFS_Unregister">.
        <P>
        The user may force a file transfer intercept by pressing <ARG>Left&nbsp;Alt</ARG> or disable an intercept by pressing <ARG>Right&nbsp;Alt</ARG>.
        <P>
        <SWIL SWI="PsiFS_InterceptPoll"> should be used to check for new intercepted file transfers when the poll word is non-zero.
