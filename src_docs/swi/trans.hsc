        This call construcst a translation table that can be used to convert between the two specified character sets.
        <P>
        The character sets can be any combination of:
        <TABLE BORDER=1 ALIGN=CENTER>
            <TR><TH>Character set</TH><TH>Description</TH></TR>
            <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT NOWRAP>0</TD><TD><RISCOS> (Latin1)</TD></TR>
            <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT NOWRAP>1</TD><TD><EPOC> (code page 850)</TD></TR>
            <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT NOWRAP>2</TD><TD><SIBO> (<WINDOWS> ANSI character set)</TD></TR>
        </TABLE>
        <P>
        Indexing the resulting table by a character code from the source character set yields the corresponding character from the destination character set or 0 if the character is unmappable.
