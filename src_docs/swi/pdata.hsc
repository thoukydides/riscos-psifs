        Write the data for the next page of a print job to the specified file. This is only appropriate for <EPOC> devices.
        <P>
        If no filename is specified then this discards the data. Note that this is not the same as cancelling the print job, as performed by <SWIL SWI="PsiFS_PrintJobCancel">.
        <P>
        The first page of a print job, number 0, contains dummy data. Reading that data via this call enables reception of the rest of the print job.
        <P>
        Reading the data for the last page of a print job ends the job.
