    <SWIU>
        This call changes <PSIFS>'s mode of operation, depending on the reason code in R0. Valid reason codes are:
        <TABLE BORDER=1 ALIGN=CENTER>
            <TR><TH>Value</TH><TH>Meaning</TH></TR>
            <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=CENTER>0</TD><TD>Inactive</TD></TR>

        </TABLE>
        <P>
        These are described separately below.

</SWI>

<HR>

<SWI NAME="PsiFS_Mode 0" NUM="520C4" DESC="Set <PSIFS> to inactive mode">
    <SWIE REG="R0">0</SWIE>
    <SWIE REG="R1" MORE>non-zero to disconnect immediately</SWIE>
    <SWIO NONE></SWIO>
    <SWIU>
        This call closes any active connection and ends use of the configured block driver. This allows other programs to use the serial port. It is equivalent to using <CMDL CMD="PsiFSDisable" HREF=":command/disbl.html">.
        <P>
        If R1 is set to a non-zero value then <PSIFS> does not wait for data to be flushed, so may result in data being lost. It should only be used as a last resort.
        <P>
        No action is taken if the block driver is already disabled.
    </SWIU>
</SWI>

<HR>

<SWI NAME="PsiFS_Mode 1" NUM="520C4" DESC="Set <PSIFS> to remote link mode">
    <SWIE REG="R0">1</SWIE>
    <SWIO NONE></SWIO>
    <SWIU>
        This call activates the configured block driver and attempts to initiate a connection to a remote <SIBO> or <EPOC> device using <PLP>. It is equivalent to using <CMDL CMD="PsiFSEnable" HREF=":command/enabl.html"> with the <ARG>-link</ARG> switch.
        <P>
        If the block driver is already enabled then either no action is taken or an error is generated depending on whether the remote link is the current mode.
    </SWIU>
</SWI>

<HR>

<SWI NAME="PsiFS_Mode 2" NUM="520C4" DESC="Set <PSIFS> to printer mirror mode">
    <SWIE REG="R0">2</SWIE>
    <SWIE REG="R1" MORE>control-terminated device name (0 for default)</SWIE>
    <SWIO NONE></SWIO>
    <SWIU>
        This call activates the configured block driver and starts copying any characters received over the serial link to the device specified by R1. Any valid file or output device may be specified. The default is to use <ARG>printer:</ARG> which allows a <SIBO> or <EPOC> device to print to the active <RISCOS>  printer without needing a special cable. It is equivalent to using <CMDL CMD="PsiFSEnable" HREF=":command/enabl.html"> with the <ARG>-print</ARG> switch.
        <P>
        If the block driver is already enabled then either no action is taken or an error is generated depending on whether the printer mirror is the current mode.
    </SWIU>
