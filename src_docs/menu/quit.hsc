<PAGE TITLE="Menu Entries" SUBTITLE="Quit" PARENT=":menu/index.html" KEYWORDS="Menu,Quit,Disconnect">

<HEADING>Quit</HEADING>
<PARA>
Selecting the <MENL TITLE="Quit"> menu entry quits both the <PSIFS> filer and the file system module. This first disconnects any active connection to a remote <SIBO> or <EPOC> device.
<P>
Moving the mouse pointer to the right over the <MENL TITLE="Quit"> sub-menu icon displays the following menu:
<MEN TITLE="Quit">
    <MENI TITLE="Filer" HREF="#filer">
    <MENI TITLE="All" HREF="#all">
</MEN>
</PARA>

<HEADING NAME="filer">Quit &gt; Filer</HEADING>
<PARA>
Selecting the <MENL TITLE="Filer"> menu entry, from the <MENL TITLE="Quit"> menu, quits the <PSIFS> filer. This leaves the <PSIFS> file system module running. Any active connection to a remote <SIBO> or <EPOC> device remains available.
</PARA>

<HEADING NAME="all">Quit &gt; All</HEADING>
<PARA>
Selecting the <MENL TITLE="All"> menu entry, from the <MENL TITLE="Quit"> menu, quits both the <PSIFS> filer and the file system module. This first disconnects any active connection to a remote <SIBO> or <EPOC> device.
<P>
This has the same effect as selecting the <MENL TITLE="Quit"> menu entry.
