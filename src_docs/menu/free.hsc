Selecting the <MENL TITLE="Free..."> menu entry displays the free space on the disc.
<P>
This normally opens an interactive free space viewer that shows the amount of unused space on the disc, together with the amount of space that has already been used. The total disc size is shown as well. The window is updated periodically if the space available on the disc changes.
<P>
If it is not possible to open an interactive free space viewer then the output from <CMDL CMD="Free" HREF=":command/free.html"> is displayed.
