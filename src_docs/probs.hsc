    <LI>Under <RISCOS VER="4"> enabling the printer mirror without an active printer connected can result in an infinite error loop due to the new parallel port error detection. There probably isn't much that can be done about this.
    <LI><RISCOS> attributes such as <ARG>LR/</ARG>, <ARG>LW/</ARG> or <ARG>LWR/</ARG> result in the <EPOC> <ARG>system</ARG> attribute being set. Unfortunately, this makes it impossible to delete the file from an <EPOC> device.
    <LI>Corrupt <ARG>tar</ARG> files can result in confusing error messages.
    <LI>Some print jobs, notably those from <NAME>Sheet</NAME>, have spurious lines plotted.
