Several additional <A HREF=":compile/tools.html" TITLE="Tools">tools</A> and <A HREF=":compile/libs.html" TITLE="Libraries">libraries</A> are required to compile <PSIFS>.
<P>
Once the tools and libraries have been correctly installed it should be sufficient to run the <ARG>MakeFile</ARG> to build both <ARG>!PsiFS.Resources.PsiFS</ARG> and <ARG>!PsiFS.Resources.!RunImage</ARG>. Similarly, the documenation can be built by running <ARG>Docs.BuildDocs</ARG>.
