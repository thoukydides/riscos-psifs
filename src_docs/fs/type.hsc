<PARA>
The <CMDL CMD="PsiFSMap" HREF=":command/map.html"> command is used to control the mapping of file types between <RISCOS> and <SIBO> or <EPOC>. The default mappings used by <PSIFS> are contained in the file <ARG>!PsiFS.Configure</ARG>, which may be modified to add extra mappings or to change the existing ones.
<P>
Note that it is not possible to change the file type of an <EPOC> file from <RISCOS>; the file type information is part of the file's contents.
