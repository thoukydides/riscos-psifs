<HEADING>Dates and Times</HEADING>
<PARA>
A direct mapping is performed between <RISCOS> and <SIBO> or <EPOC> dates and times. However, <SIBO> and <EPOC> only store file date stamps as an exact multiple of two seconds. Hence, copying a <RISCOS> file may result in the file date stamp being rounded down to give an even number of seconds. Date stamps are always accurately converted in the opposite direction.
