<HEADING>Host Computer</HEADING>
<PARA>
<PSIFS> should work on any computer running <RISCOS VER="3.1"> or higher.
<P>
It has been successfully used on:
<UL>
    <LI><B><ARC VER="A410/1"></B> fitted with <RISCOS VER="3.1">.
    <LI><B><ARC VER="A4"></B> fitted with <RISCOS VER="3.1">.

</UL>
<P>
Early <ARC> computers had faulty serial ports that required cables wired differently to operate correctly. The <3LINK> and simple <RS232> serial cable will not work unmodified with these machines, but the <ALINK> should work without problems.
</PARA>

<HEADING>Remote Computer</HEADING>
<PARA>
<PSIFS> should work with any computer running either <SIBO> (<SERIES VER="3/3a/3c/3mx">, <WORKABOUT>, <SIENA>, <PB VER="I/II"> or <XPB VER="III">) or <EPOC> (<SERIES VER="5/5mx/7">, <NETBOOK>, <REVO>, <REVO PLUS>, <GEOFOXONE>, <MC218>, <OSARIS>, <ILIUM> or <SYNERGY>) connected via a serial link.
<P>
It has been successfully used with:
<UL>

<P>
Unfortunately, some <EPOC> based mobile phones use a modified version of <PLP> that is not currently supported by <PSIFS>. This includes the <R380>, <9210> and <9290>.
</PARA>

<HEADING>Serial Link</HEADING>
<PARA>
<PSIFS> should work over any serial link that can be used with <PSIWIN> (<3LINK>, <ALINK> or a simple <RS232> serial cable for more recent machines).
<P>
It has been successfully used with the following cables:
<UL>
    <LI><B><3LINK> cable</B> (does not work unmodified on early <ARC> machines).
    <LI><B><ALINK> cable</B>.
    <LI><B><SERIES VER="5"> serial cable</B> (does not work unmodified on early <ARC> machines).
</UL>
<P>
It has been successfully used with the following serial ports:
<UL>
    <LI><B>Internal</B> serial port.
    <LI><B><SERIALPORT> dual</B> serial port card.
    <LI><B><ATOMWIDE> triple</B> serial port card.
    <LI><B><INTELLIGENT> dual</B> serial port card.
</UL>
<P>
Although it has not been tested, <PSIFS> should also work via an <IRDA> infrared link if both machines are fitted with suitable interfaces and protocol stacks.
