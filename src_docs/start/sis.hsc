<HEADING>Installing <EPOC> SIS Files</HEADING>
<PARA>
The <PSIFS> file format converter interface supports the installation of SIS files on <EPOC> devices. To use this feature, ensure that there is an active remote link and then drag a SIS file to one of the <PSIFS> iconbar icons. In the <A HREF=":menu/conv.html" TITLE="File Conversion">file conversion</A> window that opens, select the <ARG>Install&nbsp;SIS&nbsp;file</ARG> option, and click on <ARG>Install</ARG>.
<P>
<PSIFS> will automatically ensure that the <ARG>Add/remove</ARG> icon is present on the <NAME>control&nbsp;panel</NAME>. It will then copy the SIS file and start the installation process. Follow the prompts displayed on the <EPOC> device to complete the installation.
</PARA>

<HEADING>Double-clicking Files</HEADING>
<PARA>
It is also possible to start the installation of SIS files by double-clicking on their icons within filer windows. However, depending on the configuration of <PSIFS> it may be necessary to hold down the <ARG>Left&nbsp;Alt</ARG> key to force <PSIFS> to intercept the file.
