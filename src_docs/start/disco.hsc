<HEADING>Disconnecting</HEADING>
<PARA>
It is not necessary to perform any special action to terminate a <A HREF=":start/conct.html" TITLE="Connecting">connected</A> link; simply disconnect the cable or disable the software on either or both machines. However, this will not allow any other application to use the serial port. Hence, it is better to either disable or quit <PSIFS> when it is no longer required.
<P>
The remote link increases the power consumption of <SIBO> or <EPOC> devices. Hence, to maximize battery life, it is recommended that the remote link is disabled whenever it is not being used:
<UL>
    <LI>On <SIBO> devices the link is disabled using the <ARG>Remote Link</ARG> or <ARG>Communications</ARG> option from the <ARG>Special</ARG> menu, or by pressing <ARG>Psion+L</ARG> or <ARG>Acorn+L</ARG>.
    <LI>On <EPOC> devices the link is disabled using the <ARG>Remote link...</ARG> option from the <ARG>Tools</ARG> menu, or by pressing <ARG>Ctrl+L</ARG>.
</UL>
</PARA>

<HEADING>Disabling PsiFS</HEADING>
<PARA>
To disable <PSIFS> click on the iconbar icon with <MOUSE BUTTON=ADJUST> or select <MENL TITLE="Disconnect" HREF=":menu/disco.html"> from the iconbar icon menu. The <A HREF=":icon/idle.html" TITLE="Idle Icon">idle icon</A> will be displayed to indicate that the serial port is no longer being used:
<CENTER><A HREF=":icon/idle.html" TITLE="Idle Icon"><IMG SRC=":graphics/idle.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></A></CENTER>
</PARA>

<HEADING>Quitting PsiFS</HEADING>
<PARA>
To quit <PSIFS> simply click on the iconbar icon with <MOUSE BUTTON=MENU> and select <MENL TITLE="Quit"> from the menu. This will remove both the filer and file system module from memory.
