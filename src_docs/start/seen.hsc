<HEADING>Installing File Format Converters</HEADING>
<PARA>
The simplest way to use a third party file format converter with <PSIFS> is to ensure that it has been seen by the filer before <PSIFS> is loaded. Alternatively, the file format converter can be placed within the <ARG>!PsiFS.Converters</ARG> directory to ensure that it is always available.
<P>
See the documentation supplied with individual file format converters for more details or any additional requirements. The <A HREF=":faq/conv.html" TITLE="File Format Converters">file format converters</A> section of the FAQ lists the most common third party tools.
<P>
Once file format converters have been installed, they may be easily used to perform <A HREF=":start/conv.html" TITLE="Performing File Format Conversions">conversions</A>.
</PARA>

<HEADING><ARG>!ChangeFSI</ARG></HEADING>
<PARA>
<PSIFS> includes a simple file format converter that uses <ARG>!ChangeFSI</ARG> to convert common graphics formats (GIF, PCX, BMP, PBM, JPEG, TIFF, and Sprite files) to either Sprite or JPEG files with a selectable number of bits per pixel.
<P>
No installation is required to use this file format converter. If necessary, <PSIFS> automatically searches for a copy of <ARG>!ChangeFSI</ARG>, but if this fails the message <ARG>Please open a directory containing !ChangeFSI and then repeat the operation</ARG> is displayed. In this event simply open a filer window for the appropriate directory.
</PARA>

<HEADING><ARG>!PsiFS</ARG></HEADING>
<PARA>
<PSIFS> includes another simple file format converter that uses the <PSIFS> module to extract the contents of <ARG>tar</ARG> and SIS files. No installation is required to use this file format converter.
<P>
Please note that long filenames will only be preserved if <ARG>!Scrap</ARG> is located on a drive that supports long filenames.
