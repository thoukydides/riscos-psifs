<HEADING>Why are print jobs rendered inaccurately?</HEADING>
<PARA>
There are two main reasons why <EPOC> print jobs are not rendered accurately by <PSIFS>:
<UL>
    <LI>The <EPOC> print job file format is not entirely understood. In particular the purpose of some common primitives is not known, so they are simply ignored.
    <LI>The <RISCOS> graphics support does not match that of <EPOC>, especially when constrained to the features supported by <NAME>Draw</NAME> files. The most deficiency is the poor support for clipping.
</UL>
<P>
The <PLP> document, available from the <PSIFS> <A HREF=":contact/web.html" TITLE="Web Page">web page</A>, contains a description of the <EPOC> print job file format as currently understood. Please <A HREF=":contact/auth.html" TITLE="Contacting the Author">contact the author</A> with any additions or corrections.
<P>
Print jobs can be annotated by adding the line <ARG>PrintJobLogDebug=True</ARG> to the <PSIFS> configuration file (either <ARG>!Boot.Choices.PsiFS.Config</ARG> or <ARG>!PsiFS.Config.Config</ARG>, depending upon the computer's configuration). This tags each rendered primitive with a list of the primitives that immediately precede it. The name of each primitive is prefixed by the file offset to that primitive in hexadecimal.
