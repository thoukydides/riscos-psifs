<HEADING>Why are <ARG>InternalPC</ARG> and <ARG>SP_DualPC</ARG> the only serial blockdrivers offered?</HEADING>
<PARA>
<PSIFS> is supplied with copies of the <ARG>InternalPC</ARG> and <ARG>SP_DualPC</ARG> serial block drivers. These two blockdrivers support most of the common configurations.
<P>
To use other blockdrivers, for example if an unusual serial port card is being used, then <ARG>!SerialDev</ARG> must be seen by the filer before <PSIFS> is loaded. The easiest way to do this on a machine running <RISCOS VER="3.5"> or later is to place it in the <ARG>!Boot.Resources</ARG> directory.
<P>
Please note that <ARG>!SerialDev</ARG> is not distributed with <PSIFS>; it must be obtained from another source.
