<HEADING>Why is the error <ARG>SWI &amp;83901 not known</ARG> displayed when using <ARG>*PsiFSListDrivers</ARG>?</HEADING>
<PARA>
The serial block driver for <NAME>Online Media</NAME> internal modem cards is badly written. Any attempt to initialise the block driver on a machine without the card fitted results in an error that bypasses the normal error handling mechanism. This prevents <CMDL CMD="PsiFSListDrivers" HREF=":command/list.html"> from listing all of the available drivers.
<P>
To avoid this problem, open the <ARG>!SerialDev.Modules</ARG> directory, and remove the <ARG>IntModem</ARG> directory.
