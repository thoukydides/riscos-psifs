<HEADING>Why does the computer hang when <PSIFS> is enabled?</HEADING>
<PARA>
Many applications do not fully support the device claim protocol. This means that another task may start using the serial port while <PSIFS> is using it, or a task already using the serial port may not object when <PSIFS> attempts to claim it.
<P>
If a clash over use of the serial port occurs then the computer may appear to hang. Press <ARG>Escape</ARG> to regain control, then save any work and reboot the computer.
<P>
A common cause of this kind of problem is if the ANT Internet Suite is being used. <ARG>!InetSuite</ARG> accesses the serial port even when it is not using the modem, so it must be quit before enabling <PSIFS>. It is recommended that <ARG>!InetSuite</ARG> and <PSIFS> are never loaded at the same time.
