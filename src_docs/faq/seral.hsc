<HEADING>Why does <PSIFS> not work on early Archimedes?</HEADING>
<PARA>
Early <ARC> computers had faulty serial ports that required cables wired differently to operate correctly. The <ALINK> should work reliably with these machines, but the <3LINK> and simple <RS232> serial cable require an adaptor wired as follows:
<TABLE BORDER=1 ALIGN=CENTER>
    <TR><TH NOWRAP><ARC> connector<BR>(9 pin female)</TH><TH NOWRAP><3LINK> or <RS232> serial cable<BR>(9 pin male)</TH></TR>
    <TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>2 <NAME>(RxD)</NAME></TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>2 <NAME>(RxD)</NAME></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>6 <NAME>(DSR)</NAME></TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>8 <NAME>(CTS)</NAME></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
To summarise, pins 6 and 8 should be swapped, pins 1 and 4 should be joined at the <ARC> end, and pins 1 and 9 are not used. The <ARG>Internal</ARG> block driver should then be used rather than <ARG>InternalPC</ARG>.
<P>
This wiring is by Toby Smith and Jonathan Allin, but has not been tested. No resposibility is taken for any damage that may result from use of this information.
