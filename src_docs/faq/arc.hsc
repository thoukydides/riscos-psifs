<HEADING>Why do links between the help pages not work?</HEADING>
<PARA>
The <PSIFS> distribution archive is produced using <ARG>!SparkFS</ARG>; problems may be experienced if other tools are used to dearchive the files. In particular, the &quot;<ARG>/</ARG>&quot; (forward slash) character used within the names of these help files could be converted to an &quot;<ARG>_</ARG>&quot; (underscore), resulting in the links failing to work.
<P>
To avoid potential problems, all of the files should be extracted using either <ARG>!SparkFS</ARG> or <ARG>!SparkPlug</ARG> by <A HREF="mailto:david@pilling.demon.co.uk" TITLE="Send Email to David Pilling">David Pilling</A>.
