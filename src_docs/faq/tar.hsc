<HEADING>Why are the file names in a backup corrupt?</HEADING>
<PARA>
Backup files produced by <PSIFS> use the <ARG>fltar</ARG> <RISCOS> variant of <ARG>tar</ARG> files. This stores filenames using <RISCOS> rather than <NAME>UNIX</NAME> conventions. Unfortunately, some tools expect the opposite convention, so end up with corrupt the filenames.
<P>
Recent versions of <ARG>!SparkFS</ARG> operate correctly, but earlier versions get the filenames wrong. If problems are experienced then contact <A HREF="mailto:david@pilling.demon.co.uk" TITLE="Send Email to David Pilling">David Pilling</A> for an upgrade to the latest version.
<P>
Alternatively, <A HREF="mailto:fl@tools.de" TITLE="Send Email to Frank Lancaster">Frank Lancaster</A>'s public domain command line <A HREF="http://www.tools.de/fl/tar.arc"><ARG>tar</ARG></A> utility, or the <CMDL CMD="PsiFSTar" HREF=":command/tar.html"> command may be used without problems.
