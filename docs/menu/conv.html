<TABLE WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD WIDTH=30></TD><TD>A file conversion window is opened whenever a file is dragged to a <FONT COLOR="#004499"><B><I>PsiFS</I></B></FONT> iconbar icon, or a file transfer within the desktop is intercepted. The exact appearance and behaviour of the window depends on the source of the file, but the basic behaviour is the same.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<H2><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">Drag to Iconbar</FONT></H2>
<TABLE WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD WIDTH=30></TD><TD>The simplest way to perform a conversion is to drag the icon for the file to be converted to one of the <FONT COLOR="#004499"><B><I>PsiFS</I></B></FONT> iconbar icons. This opens a window from which the required conversion can be selected.
<P>
At the top of the window there is an icon for the converted file. This may be dragged to a filer window or another application to perform the conversion and save the result. Next to the file icon there is a writable field allowing the required file name to be typed.
<P>
In the middle of the window there is a field allowing the type of conversion to be selected. <FONT COLOR="#004499"><B><I>PsiFS</I></B></FONT> attempts to select the most appropriate conversion based on the type of file and past usage. When a new converter is selected the file icon changes to indicate the type of the resulting file.
<P>
There are four buttons at the bottom of the window:
<UL>
<LI><B>Info</B> - Open a window displaying information about the selected converter.
<LI><B>Options</B> - Open a window allowing options to be set for the selected converter.
<LI><B>Cancel</B> - Close the window without performing a conversion. Clicking with <I>Adjust</I> leaves the window open, but resets the options to their original values.
<LI><B>Convert</B> - Perform a conversion using the selected options. Clicking with <I>Adjust</I> performs a conversion without closing the window.
</UL></TD></TR></TABLE>
<H2><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">File Intercept</FONT></H2>
<TABLE WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD WIDTH=30></TD><TD><FONT COLOR="#004499"><B><I>PsiFS</I></B></FONT> can also intercept files double-clicked or dragged within the desktop. Only the <A HREF="confg.html" TITLE="Configure...">configured</A> intercepts are performed automatically, but this can be overridden by pressing <TT>Left&nbsp;Alt</TT> to force an intercept and allow a converter to be selected or <TT>Right&nbsp;Alt</TT> to prevent an intercept.
<P>
A the top of the window there is an icon for the converted file. The original filename and task names are also shown as appropriate.

<LI><B>Cancel</B> - Close the window without performing a conversion. Clicking with <I>Adjust</I> leaves the window open, but resets the options to their original values.
<LI><B>Load</B>, <B>Run</B> or <B>Save</B> - Perform a conversion using the selected options and close the window.

<H2><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">Installing Converters</FONT></H2>
<TABLE WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD WIDTH=30></TD><TD>It is not normally necessary to install a file format converter; ensuring that the file format converter is seen by the filer before <FONT COLOR="#004499"><B><I>PsiFS</I></B></FONT> is loaded is usually sufficient. Alterntatively, the converter may be copied to the <TT>!PsiFS.Converters</TT> directory to ensure that it is always available. However, additional steps may be required for some file format converters; see the documentation supplied with the individual file format converter for details.
<P>
If <FONT COLOR="#004499"><B><I>PsiFS</I></B></FONT> is already running then it will need to be restarted before any new converters are available.</TD></TR></TABLE>
