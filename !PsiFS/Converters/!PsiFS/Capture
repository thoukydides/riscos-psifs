REM Read the command line
SYS "OS_GetEnv" TO env$
env$ = FNskip_ws(MID$(env$, INSTR(env$, """", INSTR(env$, """") + 1) + 2))

REM Extract the filename and command
pos% = INSTR(env$, " ")
IF pos% = 0 THEN ERROR 0, "Syntax: Capture <file> <command>"
file$ = LEFT$(env$, pos% - 1)
cmd$ = FNskip_ws(MID$(env$, pos% + 1))

REM Ensure that the output file gets deleted if there is an error
ON ERROR ON ERROR OFF:SYS "XOS_FSControl", 27, file$, 0, 3:ERROR 0, REPORT$

REM Execute the command and set the type of the captured output file
SYS "OS_CLI", cmd$ + " { > " + file$ + " }"
SYS "OS_File", 18, file$, &FFF
